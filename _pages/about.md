I lead the Machine Learning Research team at the [Toyota Research Institute (TRI)](https://www.tri.global/) in Los Altos, CA, USA. My research focuses on scaling up ML for Robot Autonomy, spanning Scene and Behavior Understanding, Simulation for Deep Learning, 3D Computer Vision, and Self-Supervised Learning (cf. [a short bio](#bio) below). Outside of work, I spend time with my wife, daughter, and the mountains (I love camping, climbing, and snowboarding). You can find (some of) my [publications](/publications/), [talks](/talks/), and my [CV](/cv/) on this site.
