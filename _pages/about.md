I am the head of Machine Learning at the [Toyota Research Institute (TRI)](https://www.tri.global/) and an Adjunct Professor at Stanford, CA, USA. My work focuses on Principle-centric ML (combining knowledge and data) for Embodied Intelligence (physical ML systems), spanning Scene and Behavior Understanding, Simulation for Deep Learning, 3D Computer Vision, and Self-Supervised Learning (cf. [a short bio](#bio) and my [CV](/cv) for more info). Outside of work, I spend time with my wife, daughter, and the mountains (I love camping, climbing, and snowboarding).
