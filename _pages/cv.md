## Professional Experience

**01/2020 - : Senior Manager, Machine Learning Research, Toyota Research Institute (TRI), CA, USA.**
Head of Machine Learning Research at TRI. We explore how to learn from Experience for world-scale Autonomy. We invent and deploy new Machine Learning algorithms for Automated Driving that improve mobility and save lives. Our key research areas include Deep Learning (esp. self-supervised learning), Computer Vision (esp. dynamic 3D scene understanding), and using Simulation for ML (esp. inverse graphics and sim2real).

**07/2017 - 01/2020: Tech Lead and Manager (Machine Learning), Toyota Research Institute (TRI), CA, USA.**
Manager of the ML team at TRI. Responsible for creating and leading TRI's ML strategy for Automated Driving, from research to deployment of safety-critical ML models. Grow the team from 3 to 12 research scientists and ML engineers. External leadership via publications, invited talks, and demonstrations.

**2017 - 2020: Senior Research Scientist (Machine Learning), Toyota Research Institute (TRI), CA, USA.**
Large scale Computer Vision and Deep Learning R&D for Automated Driving. Leading multiple projects, including novel research (scene understanding, object perception, 3D vision, domain adaptation, sim2real, self- and semi-supervised learning), distributed ML cloud infrastructure (deployed in production), and transfer to prototype vehicles tested on public roads. Leading scientific collaborations with Stanford and Preferred Networks (PFN). Technical advisor for Toyota AI Ventures.

**2013 - 2016: Research Scientist (Computer Vision), Xerox Research Center Europe, Meylan, France.**
Led research and transfer projects on Deep Learning for video understanding (action recognition, multi-object tracking), domain adaptation, simulation for perception, and Business Process Modeling with Computer Vision.

**2008 - 2012: Doctoral Researcher, Microsoft Research - Inria joint center, Paris, France.**
Invented, implemented, and experimentally validated state-of-the-art Computer
Vision and Machine Learning algorithms for action recognition in
challenging real-world video sources like movies or YouTube videos.
Contributions on how to decompose actions into structured, discriminative,
and robust models.

**2008: R&D Engineer, LEAR team, Inria, Grenoble, France.**
Participation to two international Computer Vision competitions: TRECVID and
PASCAL VOC (co-winner of classification and detection challenges).
Experimentation on tens of thousands of images and videos, using a
cluster of computers, under strong time constraints.

**06-08/2007: Research intern, Inria Rocquencourt, Paris, France.**
Research on learning the structure of dynamic Bayesian networks using
statistical tests and genetic algorithms.

**06-08/2006: Research intern, LIG research lab, IMAG institute, Grenoble, France.**
Implementation (OCaml) of formal methods in the automatic proof research domain.
